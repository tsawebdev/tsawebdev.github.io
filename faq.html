<div class="doc">
  <section id="menu1">
    <a href="#menu1">What is the Recommended Age?</a>
    <p>
 While nothing in our rooms are considered inappropriate, they are specifically designed for older teens and adults. Generally, they are for high school and up. Youth 14 and under must be accompanied by at least one (1) paying and participating adult. Children 12 and under will only be allowed in private rooms.</p>
</section>

    <section id="menu2">
        <a href="#menu2">Is It Considered Scary?</a>
        <p>
Our rooms were not created with the purpose of being scary, though they are fun and exhilarating - a great experience for adrenaline junkies!</p>
</section>

<section id="menu3">
  <a href="#menu3">How Long Will the Experience Last?</a>
  <p>
If you arrive on time, your escape-room experience will take 60 minutes or less - depending on whether you escape or not! This applies to both our mobile services and our location. Since there will be travel time on our end for our mobile services, we'll give you a phone call ahead of time so we can schedule properly.</p>
</section>

<section id="menu4">
  <a href="#menu4">Can I Take Photos and Videos Inside the Rooms?</a>
  <p>
Photography and video recordings are prohibited at all times within our rooms, including inside our mobile trailers. This means no cell phones, flip phones, cameras, etc. If you and your group want a picture together after you're done, our staff will be happy to help.</p>
</section>

<section id="menu5">
  <a href="#menu5">Can We Bring Outside Food and Beverages in With Us?</a>
  <p>
We do not allow and food or beverages in our rooms at any time. Although we provide bottles of water for our guests, you may not take them in the rooms with you.</p>
</section>

<section id="menu6">
  <a href="#menu6">Are You Handicap Accessable?</a>
  <p>
Yes, our mobile rooms and our location are fully handicap accessible. For any questions on handicap accessibility, please contact us.</p>
</section>

<section id="menu7">
  <a href="#menu7">Will We Be Recorded in the Rooms?</a>
  <p>
Our cameras are purely to ensure your safety during your experience, and so our employees can keep track of how youâ€™re doing in case you need a hint. The cameras provide a live video feed, but they do not save a recording of you. </p>
</section>

<section id="menu8">
  <a href="#menu8">Can I Book a Room as Private?</a>
  <p>
Yes, you can reserve rooms at our facility. Otherwise, we can't guarantee that your group will be the only ones in the rooms. It's a great experience for meeting new people! Since only one person is paying for the mobile rooms to come to a specific location, your party will be the only participants, no matter how many people there are. </p>
</section>

<section id="menu9">
  <a href="#menu9">Is There Anywhere You Won't Take Your Mobile Trailers?</a>
  <p>
There aren't many places that we won't take our mobile trailers. The only exceptions are apartment buildings, parks, and public locations (without the owner's consent.) Find out more about our mobile experience on our Mobile page!</p>
