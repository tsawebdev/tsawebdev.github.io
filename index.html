     <h1> So, What Is An Escape Room?</h1>
     <p>Fundamentally, an escape room is a multifaceted time-based experience that relies on quick thinking, puzzle-solving skills, and an ability to function under pressure. (note: it isn’t necessary to function well under pressure). There is a time limit that differs for every room, based on the room’s difficulty. Our escape rooms aren’t meant to be frightening or extensively stressful, so don’t worry, they’re perfectly suitable for children ages 12 and up. The end goal is to escape the room (or rooms) using the slight clues, hints, or leads we provide. But don’t worry, you’ll have to do a bit of looking for those too.</p>

    <h1>Why Choose An Escape Room?</h1>
    <p>Here at On The Run Escape Rooms, our soul purpose is entertaining you, your friends, family, or even coworkers with our innovative, immersive, challenging, and 100% pure fun. We have one physical location where you can come with friends, family, or bring the kids for a birthday party.</p>

    <h2> Office Parties / Team Building Exercises  </h2>
    <p>Having one of the largest Escape Room complexes in the area, we are perfectly suited for large groups such as whole offices and team building exercises. At On The Run Escape, your group can work in one large room or at multiple rooms. Extra large groups of up to 25 can rotate through rooms with a time limit of 30 minutes, creating a tournament-like experience!</p>

   <div class="column2">
    <h2> Birthday Parties / Special Events </h2>
    <p> An escape room is a fun, memorable, and entertaining way to celebrate birthdays or other events such as anniversaries. If you have a group of 10-12 people, you can privately book the room so that only your group is participating at one time. Otherwise, other people may be grouped with you for your experience, but it’s a great way to meet new people and maybe introduce a new helpful skill set into your party! If you’re having a party at home, On The Run Escape Rooms also offers a mobile service, where we take the fun to you! Send us your address and we can transport our mobile room setup right to your door! Learn more on our Mobile page! (This applies to any other functions, occasions, or events as well)</p>

    <h2> Date Night / Friends </h2>
    <p>Working together in a team-based environment can provide a great bonding experience for you and your significant other, or be a great night out with a couple friends! If you spend 60 minutes in one of our escape rooms, you’ll spend days talking about it afterwards!</p>
