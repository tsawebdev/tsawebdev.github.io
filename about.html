      <h3>Who Is On The Run Escape?</h3>
      <p>On The Run Escape is a small company located in the United States. We started up the company in 2016 as a group of idealistic highschool students who wanted to bring puzzle-solving fun to the people of our hometown. Unlike most most escape room companies, On The Run Escape will bring the experience to you if you so desire! Visit our <a href="mobile.html">Mobile</a> page for the details.</p>

   <h2>Our Mission</h2>
   <p>Here at On the Run Escape Rooms, we strive to bring you the best experience possible. We value quality in all of our rooms, and most importantly, your enjoyment; whether it be at our on-site location or a mobile room. </p>

 <h2>What We Do</h2>
 <p>On the Run Escape Rooms isn’t a normal escape room company… We’re the best there is! We offer 3 different experiences (though our creative minds are currently working on more) both at our facility and on the run! Unlike most other companies, we have a program where we’ll pack up an escape room into a trailer and bring the experience to you. Birthday parties and other special events will be better than any you’ve ever experienced before! As well as our mobile rooms, we have a large location and are great for large groups such as whole offices for team building exercises. Check out our other pages for more info on how to book your experiene today!</p>
