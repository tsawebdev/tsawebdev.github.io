   <h2>Our Mission</h2>
   <p>Here at On the Run Escape Rooms, we strive to bring you 100% pure fun. We value quality of all of our rooms and most importantly, your experience; whether it be at our on-site location or a mobile room. </p>

 <h2>What We Do</h2>
 <p>On the Run Escape Rooms isn’t a normal escape room company… We’re the best there is! We offer 3 different experiences (though we’re always working to provide more) both at our location and possibly - At your house! Unlike most other companies, we have a program where we’ll pack up an escape room into a trailer and bring the experience to you. Birthday parties and other special events will be better than any you’ve ever experienced before! As well as our mobile rooms, we have a large location and are great for large groups such as whole offices for team building exercises. Escape rooms are great bonding experiences. Our website goes over what we do in more depth, so please enjoy!</p>
