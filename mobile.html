   <h1 id="intro">THE BASICS</h1>
   <p>If you are having a special event at home or any privately owned venue and would prefer not to travel to our location, we can bring the experience to you! We will bring our mobile trailer to your address and your party can enjoy the escape room without having to travel further than the front of your house! You will get a brief set of instructions, and then you’re off.

     <h1> Where We'll Go</h1>
     <p>The only places we won’t take our Mobile trailers are public places (including apartment complexes), unless you have consent from the owner to do so. You’ll also have to be within a 45-mile radius of our HQ. In addition, our trailers are larger than a shipping van and in turn need adequate parking space, so be sure to leave room on the curbside outside your house or otherwise on your property.</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class="column2">
      <h1>How To Book</h1>
      <p>Along with contacting us to confirm your order as usual, you’ll need to send us a bit more information. Please include the following; the full address of the location we should come to, what room/rooms you’d like to book (see the <a href="rooms.html">Rooms page</a> for the experiences we offer, they are all the same for our mobile services), and how many people will be present. Our trailers have less space than our HQ’s rooms do, so less people will be able to participate per room. (Below is a list of the recommended capacity for each different room)  If needed, we can send two separate trailers so that everyone at your party can have a good time!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="column3">
     <h1>Mobile Pricing</h1>
     <p>For our mobile rooms, We also charge for miles driven to cover the cost of gas. Expect to play around $0.50 a mile, so keep this into consideration when planning a party.</p>
